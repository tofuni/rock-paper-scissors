# rock-paper-scissors
An implementation of a "rock, paper, scissors" game that is meant to apply introductory and foundational JS concepts learned from [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

V1 of this game is meant to highlight the concepts learned from Fundamentals 1-3 in the JavaScript Basics modules, which includes understanding how to work with variables, numbers, strings, conditionals, and functions. The end result features a simple, five-round game that is meant to be played from the browser console.
