# rock-paper-scissors
An implementation of a "rock, paper, scissors" game that is meant to apply introductory and foundational JS concepts learned from [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

V1 of this game is meant to highlight the concepts learned from Fundamentals 1-3 in the JavaScript Basics modules, which includes understanding how to work with variables, numbers, strings, conditionals, and functions. The end result features a simple, five-round game that is meant to be played from the browser console. 

V2 of this game demonstrates additional concepts learned such as working with arrays, loops, DOM manipulation, and events. The end results features a first-to-five game that can be played via a UI.

The live demo for V2 can be found [here](https://tofuni.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).
